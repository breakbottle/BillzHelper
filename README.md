## Motivation
I have been using my bills helper for years, since 2003. I've re-built it many times. The project started in excel, then upgraded to php/mysql 
as I depended more on it, I continued to add more features. In 2012, I wanted to do some more work on the UI, MVC was popular, therefore I 
choosed to re-build with c# MVC still using mysql database. However, I had no time to finish, as a result I 
ended up just using the old system. 2013 I attempted again to upgrade this time i went back to just php/mysql i was able to 
add only the important features, bring in some newer technologies to the project like bootstrap and converted alot of the ui work that was done in
PHP previously to jQuery/CSS fun. However, again had no time to dedicate to the project. 

Now I find myself trying to get more fluent in FrontEnd techologies that I use at work and other projects. Finaly, I'm rebuilding again
using the **MEAN Stack** where **M** is MySQL (The data is still there). Once I'm finish adding
back all the old good features and the new futuristic ones. I will then migrated data to MongoDB.
